This was a very excellent book. It started out a little boring, as most books do, but it definitely redeemed itself later on throughout each chapter. There are a lot of parallels within this book. It first just begins with the kids' summer and what they were doing throughout the school year. Later on, it transitions into the children's curiosity about Boo Radley and trying to get him to come out of the house, then Miss Maudie's house caught on fire, and then Atticus took on the role of defending Tom. The ending was, of course, not the ending that everyone would have longed for but in a way this book is informational. People do not have a lot of knowledge when it comes to racism and how times were back then. This book portrays one of the many hateful things that were done to colored people then. The sad thing is that it wasn't even too long ago.</div>

To Kill A Mockingbird is one of the best books I've ever read, and I've read a LOT of books.  The plot doesn't seem to make sense to some people, but I thought that it was great.  All the characters were so well developed and the emotions that Scout felt hit me hard.  My favorite character has to be Atticus though, just because of the fact that he believes in equality for everyone. I'm sure that during the early 1900's, not too many people thought this way.  I think that everyone should give this book a try.</div>

I actually bought this from my school's bookstore a little more than a month ago since it was a requirement. We were given three papers to write our reader response journal in, one for chapters 1-10, one for chapters 11-20, and the last one for chapters 21-31. For the first month, I actually found the book uninteresting and boring, since I couldn't get past the first chapter at all. But when our teacher introduced a comprehension check this week, I began to get serious and started reading it. 

I started over again; began taking down notes and reading summaries every day before the comprehensive check so that I'm prepared. Our teacher also told us to make connections in the text; either from our life experiences or other books we've read. I approached the book that way and found myself enjoying it all throughout. I noticed how chapters 1-10 reminded me of my early childhood in elementary school and chapters 11-20 about some other texts I read before (I haven't reached chapters 21-31 by the time I'm writing this).

Like what people said, this book is either a hit or a miss. It was a hit for me if you can't already tell..</div>
